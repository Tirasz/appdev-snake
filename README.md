Project is supposed to be a maven project, so i dont know, but:
  - Open Snake folder with IntelliJ IDEA as a project
  - Let Maven do it's thing
  - Find the db.properties file (snake-core/src/main/resources)
  - Change the db.url property to: " jdbc:sqlite:<absolute path to>/db.properties " (same folder as db.properties file, without quotation marks)
